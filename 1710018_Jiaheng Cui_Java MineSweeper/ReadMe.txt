这是一个基于Java课上学的知识的Java小程序，是一款基于Java Swing的扫雷游戏。
我试图使它看起来与Windows XP中的MineSweeper游戏非常相似，我小时候就很喜欢它。
欢迎您下载并尝试。

已知的瑕疵：
1.这不是一个可运行的.exe文件，因此您需要在计算机上安装JDK（至少是jdk8）和Java IDE（我已经尝试过VS Code和IntelliJ）。
2.它不包含任何声音效果，因此与Windows版本相比，您可能会觉得不那么有趣。
3.有时点击鼠标时并不会有响应，此时请再次单击。我不知道这个bug的确切原因。
  我在CSDN上所发现，这可能是因为当时线程被占用，但那个网站并没有给我一个有说服力的理由。
  如果您知道答案，请与我联系。 ^^
  
最后，感谢向老师对我的教导，感谢Alexhaoge同学建立的Github库，感谢我的朋友William3对于游戏的评测。

This is a tiny application of Java based on the knowledge learned in class. 
It's a MineSweeping game, based on Java Swing.
I've tried to make it look much alike the MineSweeper game in Windows XP, which I liked a lot when I was a kid.
So please feel free to try it.

Known defects:
1. It is not a runnable .exe file, so you need JDK(at least jdk8) and Java IDE(I've tried VS Code and IntelliJ) installed on your computer.
2. It does not include any sound effects, so you may feel less interesting compared to the Windows version.
3. Sometimes there is no response when the mouse is clicked, please click for a second time. I don't know the exact reason.
   It's posssibly because that the thread was busy at that time, as I've found on CSDN, but it didn't give me a persuasive reason.
   If you know the answer, please contact me. ^^
   
In the very end, thanks to Prof. Xiang for teaching Java, to my classmate Alexhaoge who created this Github repository, and to my friend William3 for testing the game.
